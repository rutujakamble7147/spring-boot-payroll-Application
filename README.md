### A sample spring boot rest application and demo rest methods

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style used in web development for building \
scalable, performant, and maintainable web services. RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) \
is an implementation of the REST architecture.

RESTful API is a type of web API that is designed to work with HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests \
such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc., to retrieve, create, update or delete resources on the web. \
RESTful APIs use HTTP methods to define the actions to be performed on resources, and use \
URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify resources.

RESTful APIs typically return data in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language) \
format, which are both lightweight and easy to parse. They also use hypermedia links to navigate between \
resources and represent the state of the system.

RESTful APIs are widely used in modern web development for creating web services that are easy to consume, \
scalable, and platform-agnostic. They are used by many popular web applications and services, such as Twitter, \
Facebook, and Google Maps.

### Spring Boot Annotations:
1. `@Component`: The `@Component` annotation is used to mark a Java class as a Spring component, which \
   means that it will be automatically detected by the Spring container and instantiated as a bean. \
   For example, you can annotate a DAO class with @Component to make it available for auto wiring in \
   other Spring components.

2. `@Bean`: The `@Bean` annotation is used to declare a Spring bean manually in a configuration class. \
   It is typically used for complex beans that require some customization or initialization, and cannot \
   be created with just the @Component annotation. For example, you can define a custom DataSource bean \
   using the @Bean annotation.

3. `@ComponentScan`: The `@ComponentScan` annotation is used to specify the base package(s) that Spring \
   should scan for components. By default, Spring scans the package that contains the configuration class, \
   but you can use @ComponentScan to specify additional packages or exclude certain packages from scanning.

4. `@Configuration`: The `@Configuration` annotation is used to indicate that a class is a Spring configuration
   class, which means that it contains bean definitions and other configuration metadata. A configuration \
   class is typically used to define beans using the @Bean annotation or to import other configuration classes.

5. `@PostConstruct`: The `@PostConstruct` annotation is used to specify a method that should be called after \
   the bean has been instantiated and all its dependencies have been injected. This method can be used for \
   initialization tasks that require access to the bean's dependencies.

6. `@PreDestroy`: The `@PreDestroy` annotation is used to specify a method that should be called before the \
   bean is destroyed. This method can be used for cleanup tasks that need to be performed when the bean is \
   no longer needed.

7. `SpringBootApplication` : `@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all the following:
    1. `@SpringBootConfiguration`: Tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the Application Context or \
       Spring IOC Container.
    2. `@EnableAutoConfiguration`: Tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, \
       and various property settings. For example, if spring-webmvc is on the classpath, this annotation flags the \
       application as a web application and activates key behaviors, such as setting up a DispatcherServlet.
    3. `@ComponentScan`: Tells Spring to look for other `@Component`, `@Configuration`, `@Controller` and `@Service` \
       in the com/basecs101 package, letting it find the classes to create beans.

8. `@SpringBootTest` : Marks the class as Spring boot test class

9. `@RestController` : The `@RestController` annotation is a specialization of the `@Controller` annotation in Spring Boot that is used to indicate that the annotated class is a REST controller. \
   When a class is annotated with `@RestController`, Spring Boot automatically maps the methods in the class to specific HTTP requests based on the method annotations such as `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@PatchMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, etc. The methods return the response as JSON or XML data, depending on the content type of the request. \
   The `@RestController` annotation combines the `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` annotations, which means that all methods in the controller class will return the response as the body of the HTTP response, rather than returning a view name that would be resolved by a view resolver. \
   This annotation is commonly used in Spring Boot applications that serve as RESTful web services, where the application provides a set of HTTP endpoints to expose functionality to client applications or other services.

10. `@RequestMapping`: This annotation is used to map a method to a specific URI and HTTP request method. It is a versatile annotation that can be used to handle all HTTP methods, including GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. Example:
    ```Java
    @RequestMapping(value = "/users", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public List<User> getAllUsers() {
    // method logic
    }

11. `@GetMapping`: This annotation is a shortcut for @RequestMapping with method GET. It is used to map a method to a specific URI using HTTP GET method. Example:

    ```Java
    @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
    public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // method logic
    }

12. `@PostMapping`: This annotation is used to map a method to a specific URI using HTTP POST method. Example:

    ```Java
    @PostMapping("/users")
    public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
    // method logic
    }

13. `@PutMapping`: This annotation is used to map a method to a specific URI using HTTP PUT method. Example:

    ```Java
    @PutMapping("/users/{id}")
    public User updateUser(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody User user) {
    // method logic
    }

14. `@PatchMapping`: This annotation is used to map a method to a specific URI using HTTP PATCH method. Example:

    ```Java
    @PatchMapping("/users/{id}")
    public User updateUserPartial(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Map<String, Object> updates) {
    // method logic
    }

15. `@DeleteMapping`: This annotation is used to map a method to a specific URI using HTTP DELETE method. Example:

    ```Java
    @DeleteMapping("/users/{id}")
    public void deleteUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
    // method logic
    }

16. `@RequestParam`: This annotation is used to map a request parameter to a method parameter. It is used to extract a specific parameter value from the request URL. Example:

```Java   
@GetMapping("/users")
public List<User> getUsersByPage(@RequestParam int page) {
// method logic
}

17. `@PathVariable`: This annotation is used to extract a URI variable and map it to a method parameter. Example:

```Java
@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public User getUserById(@PathVariable Long id) {
// method logic
}

18. `@RequestBody`: This annotation is used to map the request body to a method parameter. It is used to extract the request payload and convert it into an object. Example:

```Java
@PostMapping("/users")
public User createUser(@RequestBody User user) {
// method logic
}

19. `@ResponseBody`: This annotation is used to indicate that the method return value should be used as the response body. It is used to convert the response object into JSON or XML format. Example:

```Java
@GetMapping("/users")
@ResponseBody
public List<User> getAllUsers() {
// method logic
}

20. `@ControllerAdvice`: This annotation is used to define global exception handling for controllers. It is used to handle exceptions across all controller methods. Example:

```Java   
@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
@ExceptionHandler(EmployeeNotFoundException.class)
public ResponseEntity<String> handleEmployeeNotFoundException(EmployeeNotFoundException ex) {
// method logic
}
}

21. `@ExceptionHandler(EmployeeNotFoundException.class)`: This annotation is used to define an exception handling method for a specific exception. It is used to handle a specific exception thrown by a controller method. Example:

```Java
@GetMapping("/employees/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Employee> getEmployeeById(@PathVariable Long id) {
   Employee employee = employeeService.getEmployeeById(id);
   if (employee == null) {
      throw new EmployeeNotFoundException("Employee")
}

22. `@Value` : This annotation is used for reading value of the variable of application.yml into classes as field names.
23. `@Profile` : This is used to set a profile. eg. local, dev , stg, prod etc.
> The main() method uses Spring Boot’s SpringApplication.run() method to launch an application. Did you notice that there was not a single line of XML? There is no web.xml file, either. This web application is 100% pure Java and you did not have to deal with configuring any plumbing or infrastructure.

### HTTP Status Codes:

---

#### 2xx
1. `200` OK - Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
2. `201` - Created - The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.[5]
3. `202` - Accepted - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed. The request might or might not be eventually acted upon, and may be disallowed when processing occurs.

---
#### 3xx
1. `301` Moved Permanently - This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

---
#### 4xx
1. `400` Bad Request - The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
2. `401` Unauthorized - Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means "unauthorised", the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.
   Some sites incorrectly issue HTTP 401 when an IP address is banned from the website (usually the website domain) and that specific address is refused permission to access a website.[citation needed]
3. `402` Payment Required - Reserved for future use. The original intention was that this code might be used as part of some form of digital cash or micropayment scheme, as proposed, for example, by GNU Taler,[13] but that has not yet happened, and this code is not widely used. Google Developers API uses this status if a particular developer has exceeded the daily limit on requests.[14] Sipgate uses this code if an account does not have sufficient funds to start a call.[15] Shopify uses this code when the store has not paid their fees and is temporarily disabled.[16] Stripe uses this code for failed payments where parameters were correct, for example blocked fraudulent payments.[17]
4. `403` Forbidden - The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication by answering the WWW-Authenticate header field challenge, but the server did not accept that authentication. The request should not be repeated.
5. `404` Not Found - The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
6. `405` Method Not Allowed - A request method is not supported for the requested resource; for example, a GET request on a form that requires data to be presented via POST, or a PUT request on a read-only resource.

---
#### 5xx
1. `500` Internal Server Error - A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
2. `501` Not Implemented - The server either does not recognize the request method, or it lacks the ability to fulfil the request. Usually this implies future availability (e.g., a new feature of a web-service API).
3. `502` Bad Gateway - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.
4. `503` Service Unavailable - The server cannot handle the request (because it is overloaded or down for maintenance). Generally, this is a temporary state.[30]
5. `504` Gateway Timeout - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and did not receive a timely response from the upstream server.


Logging and log levels:
set the logging parameter in application.yml
`logging:
level:
root: info`

Log levels and their order in descending order.

1. `fatal`
2. `error`
3. `warn`
4. `info`
5. `debug`
6. `trace`
